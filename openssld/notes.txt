read FAQ, INSTALL.W32

steps to rebuild or get new versions
- download openssl-1.0.1c.tar.gzip
- gzip -d openssl-1.0.1c.tar.gzip   // I used mingw tools 
- tar -xvf openssl-1.0.1c.tar       // seriously, really usefull

from openssl-1.0.1c directory
>perl Configure VC-WIN32 no-asm --prefix=c:\TestUtilities\SIPped\SIPped\src\openssl
>ms\do_ms

from visual studio cmd prompt, go to same directory
>nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak   // if Failed to write the updated manifest - close visual studio and try again, otherwise manifest tool, embed manifest = false (race conditionon multi-core cpu with msvs2005 on vista) 
>nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak test   
>nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install

this results in the files in dir c:\TestUtilities\SIPped\SIPped\src\openssl

in file openssl/include/openssl/dtls1.h , replace #include <winsock.h> with #include <winsock2.h>
 otherwise 100 errors come from redifining things.

Do this again but change the initial step to the following (see noteworthy for explanation)

>perl Configure debug-VC-WIN32 no-asm --prefix=c:\TestUtilities\SIPped\SIPped\src\openssld

NOTEWORTHY 

If you link with static OpenSSL libraries [those built with ms/nt.mak],
 then you're expected to additionally link your application with
 WS2_32.LIB, ADVAPI32.LIB, GDI32.LIB and USER32.LIB
 note that the last three are probably inherited from default project anyway

version 1 and later of openssl use winsock2.h libraries instead of winsock.h
 older version of openssl build on winsock.h and there will be many compiler
 errors since w32 sipp builds on winsock2.h (redefinition errors etc).

application must link against the same version of the Win32C-Runtime against 
which your openssl libraries were linked.  The default version for OpenSSL 
is /MD - "Multithreaded DLL". sipped is normally built and used as debug versions.

Note that debug and release libraries are NOT interchangeable.  If you
built OpenSSL with /MD your application must use /MD and cannot use /MDd.

building once with debug and once without means that sipped debug version must
link to the openssld directoty and the release vesion must link to the openssl dirctory

If you link with OpenSSL .DLLs, then you're expected to include into
 your 
application code small "shim" snippet, which provides glue between
 OpenSSL 
BIO layer and your compiler run-time. Look up OPENSSL_Applink
 reference 
page for further details.
