- Remove -fsm and -fcm short names for -force_server_mode and -force_client_mode.
- Only accept incoming TCP/TLS connections from remote host in -mc mode to prevent side-effects
  Other unregistered phones.

- Improve SSL-related error messages.
- Change cakey.bin to cakey.pem in WindowsBinary folder to match SIPp default names
- Added Google Test unit test framework
- Changes towards native Win32 execution (supporting libraries, refactoring of existing code).

3.2.20 Dec-8-2011
- Use posix_spawn() or spawnvep() instead of fork/exec for performing <exec> operation to work around cygwin bug and prepare for Win32 port.
- Add support for Radiotap and 802.11 QoS RTP playback
- Improve error message when SIPp gets RESPONSE when it was execting a request.
- Trace_debug no longer automatically enable trace_exec (so we can debug exec-related issues)
- cppcheck cleanup (should have no effect)
- Convert .c files to .cpp and remove extern "C" statements. Fix the few issues caused by C++ rather than C compiler rules
- Now properly sets default transaction as -1 rather than 0.
- Cleaned up the xp_convert_special_characters function.
- Disable buffered output for debug and exec logs so log files get generated even if process is aborted.
- Update error message with more detail when attempting to use start_txn with responses.

3.2.18 Oct-24-2011
- Add many SSL enhancements
- When there is a nop SIPp is forced into client mode, for TLS default to server mode.  Also default to port 5061 for TLS.
- Make SIPp able to use the certificates in the directory in which sipp is being run from by using "SIPPED" environment variable to check direction sipp is in, as well as continuing to support certificates in the current directory.
- Add -force_client_mode and -fcm to force client mode. Also added -force_server_mode/-fsm to force server mode.
- Better error message when recieves response while expecting request.
- Fix 'assertion failure when aa in forced client mode' bug  [happens when incoming TCP connection is established, handled with auto-answer, but the code 'expects' to be in server mode.]  If sipp trys to autorespond without a socket set up for the current call (like in the case above), sipp tries sending back on the last socket open (which should be the port opened to send the unexpected message in the first place).
- Fix RTP playback from correct IP on multi-homed machiens (bind rtp socket to media_ip, transmit as UDP, not raw).
- Fix crash when no scenario is specified (ie neither -sf nor -sn)
- Fix .xml stripping from scenario file parameter (-sf)
- Set deadcall_time to 0 with -mc by default
- Improved error/trace/debug logs associated with exec and raw socket failure
- Support RTP playback from cooked format (in prepare_pcap)
- Optimize load of SIPp with large files (strstr replaced)


3.2.17 09-09-2011

- Encoding attribute for DialogSpecific keywords
- Eliminate bind error crash if wrong IP specified with -i
- Improve error messages
- Verify that value associated with argument exists (is not another argument)

3.2.16 08-12-2011
- Add check_it and check_it_inverse to strcmp that aborts test if result is not 0 (that is, if the strings don't match). 
- Prettification of Error messages
- -dsd option as shortcut for dump_sequence_diagram [just have "dsd" do identical thing as "dump_sequence_diagram" in array of command line arguments]
- improved rsipp error messages
- All errors (after parameter parsing) output to log file for easier integration with AutoTester; precise return codes for those prior to log availability.



3.2.15 08-09-2011
- RTP playback (play_pcap_X) support for 802.1q (VLAN) tagging.
- Support running sipp files that use play_pcap_* from another directory (especially as this is how TA framework launches SIPp).
- Add full DTD for <test>, arithmetic operators and other missing tags
- Improve windows test harness
- Make CTRL-C cause FAIL not PASS in receive_call test case
- Ensure that check_it_inverse does not trigger the 'variable used one time error' for all functions that have it. - Done Aug 2, 2011
- Ensure SIPp return codes are sufficient to understand the reason for exit and use those reason codes to make the Rsipp output english.
- Fix generation of Content-Length: [len] when used in middle of header list and no body.
- Improve error message associated with unknown response CSEQ method when mixing start_txn and non-txn usage.
- Log error message rather than crash when \n encountered in [keywords].
- Report error if [remote_ip] used but not specified on command line - Done July 12 2011 
- No longer auto-generate remote_tag if unspecified; Implement generated="true"|"false" attribute for [remote_tag] and [remote_tag_param] 
  such that it is auto-generated ONLY if generated="true" is specified.


3.2.14 06-13-2011
- SIPp crashing when ']' missing from keyword parameter.  Removed tsrc, as it wasn't actually doing anything except when 
the scenario file was misformatted.  Added error message when end of keyword character is missing.
- Add check_it="true" option to <text> tag to cause SIPp to return FAIL if test returns false.
- Allow <test> tag to operate on string types (automatically converting results to doubles) so regexp matches can be tested.
- Accept xml encoding of < > & ' and " in the &lt; &gt; &amp; &quot; &apos;
- Implement encoding="uri" attribute for keywords
- Implement Windows-native test harness so testing of pcap and ossl functionality possible.
- SIPp to listen only for traffic FROM a specific address. This will allow it to ignore unrelated traffic (like REGISTER requests from 
other phones). Must also allow multiple instances running at the same time.  Made a change for the case when -mc is enabled, and SIPp 
is running as a client.  In this case the socket can be connected to the given remote address so all other traffic is ignored.  Made a 
change to the sipp do connect function, to let connect be called on UDP sockets when only one call is being run.
- If script stops early due to 'Q' being pressed this is FAIL, not PASS (change SIPp return code).
- Calculate source RTP ports at or before streaming of Video & Audio RTP so that source port of 0 is never used => instead use same port 
that is transmitted (later) in SIPp's SDP response. Must not break support for renegotiating SDP ports in subsequent reINVITEs / dialogs. 
Added "media_port_offset" to allow the user to set offsets for each pcap play.  If you wish to run RTP before the SDP is sent out simply 
set offset to zero.  Added functionality in sendpackets to allow each pcap play to mantain it's own port throughout the entire play.  Added 
parsing to get the offset, and generalized it to use in the parsing of offsets for other elements as well (such as when the sdp contains 
[media_port+#]).
- Remove RTP-related startup debug output 



3.2.13 05-21-2011
- Must not return fail code for non errors such as "The minor watchdog timer 500ms has been tripped" (Disabled watchdog when -mc is enabled.)
- Aligned Pause and NOP in the sequence diagram (add/remove whitespace)
- Fix typo in SSL
- Don't display the error (or return error return code) message if the phone is doing -aa and receives a register: this is by design!
- Implement short header support by matching [last_X] in short form to long form and vice versa and transposing the result to the correct 
format. For example [last_i:] will match 'call-id: Value' header in previous messages and the resulting output will be changed to 
'i: value' in output. Likewise [last_Call-Id] will match 'i: value' in previous message and the resulting output will be changed to 
'Call-Id: value'.  Added logic to call.cpp to allow sipp to go back and forth between the long and short form headers in get_header 
(originally just checked for short name given long). 
(Added an "alt_name" helper function which returns the short/long form given the 
long/short form. Added some helpful debug messages when the header is not found.  Updated test cases to add a check for this functionality.)


3.2.12 05-13-2011
- Add transaction support (use_txn, start_txn)
- Add transaction support to keywords client_cseq*, server_cseq*, received_cseq*, cseq*, branch, last_branch, last_cseq_number, last_request_uri, last_message, last_*
- Aborting rather than warn when regex with checkit fails
- Allow re-use of regex variable names (eliminate false positivies)
- Support auto-generation of remote_tag
- Ensure manually generated call-id will be stored when message is sent (ie Call-ID: [call_id dialog="2] in a message within dialog 3 will adopt call-id 3) 



3.2.11 03-31-2011
- Improve parsing out of leading tabs and whitespace within CDATA sections
- Improve parsing of next_url, contact_, to_, from_ uri & name_and_uri parameters to exclude parameters after 1st >
- Tentative support for exec pcap_play on Windows
- Adjust exec_xml_character_conversion testcase for Linux & Windows support (echo "something" produces different results depending on platform)



3.2.10 02-24-2011
- Perform conversion of &lt; (<), &amp; (&), &gt; (>), &quot; ("), and &apos; (') in exec command and verify.
- Correct [cseq] keyword behavior to only reflect outgoing transactions (no longer updated on recv)
- Add last_cseq_number (extracted from last_cseq), received_cseq and received_cseq_method (based on last received request), cseq_method (based on last sent request), last_branch 
- Update parser to ignore embedded <scenario> <?xml> and <!DOCTYPE tags to facilitate xml-compliant include files
- Untested implementation of improved start-txn and use-txn tags
- Minor parser bug-fixes including ability now to place <scenario> tag immediately following <!DOCTYPE> tag.



3.2.9 02-07-2011
- Start in client mode even when first message is <recv> if <nop> preceeds it and -mc was specified (this eliminates need for <init> section in most cases).
- Fix bug associated with <exec command> as first statement
- Improve redirected output on windows, including waiting and retrying opening of exec log file to serialize exec output.
- Ensure dialog parameter not used with -mc option.


3.2.8 01-13-2011
- Add -trace_exec, -exec_file, -exec_overwrite parameters (to log stdout/stderr output from <exec>).
- Add -debug_file, -debug_overwrite parameters
- Add [contact_uri], [contact_value], [to_uri], [to_value], [from_uri], [from_value] keywords
- Add <exec verify="..."> option that waits for command to exit and validates return code was 0, aborting if not.
- Allow use of [remote_ip] and [local_ip] keywords in <init> section
- Modify tapress.pl to have delay between all key presses (rather than just digits)



3.2.7 12-20-2010
- Add [local_tag] [local_tag_param]
- Ad dump_xml  and -dump_sequence_diagram options
- Add parameterized includes




3.2.6 12-08-2010
