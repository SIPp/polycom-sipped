This file tracks changes responsible for version number updates.
3.2.12 05-13-2011
- Add transaction support (use_txn, start_txn)
- Add transaction support to keywords client_cseq*, server_cseq*, received_cseq*, cseq*, branch, last_branch, last_cseq_number, last_request_uri, last_message, last_*
- Aborting rather than warn when regex with checkit fails
- Allow re-use of regex variable names (eliminate false positivies)
- Ensure manually generated call-id will be stored when message is sent (ie Call-ID: [call_id dialog="2] in a message within dialog 3 will adopt call-id 3) 

3.2.11 03-31-2011
- Improve parsing out of leading tabs and whitespace within CDATA sections
- Improve parsing of next_url, contact_, to_, from_ uri & name_and_uri parameters to exclude parameters after 1st >
- Tentative support for exec pcap_play on Windows
- Adjust exec_xml_character_conversion testcase for Linux & Windows support (echo "something" produces different results depending on platform)

3.2.10 02-24-2011
- Perform conversion of &lt; (<), &amp; (&), &gt; (>), &quot; ("), and &apos; (') in exec command and verify.
- Correct [cseq] keyword behavior to only reflect outgoing transactions (no longer updated on recv)
- Add last_cseq_number (extracted from last_cseq), received_cseq and received_cseq_method (based on last received request), cseq_method (based on last sent request), last_branch 
- Update parser to ignore embedded <scenario> <?xml> and <!DOCTYPE tags to facilitate xml-compliant include files
- Untested implementation of improved start-txn and use-txn tags
- Minor parser bug-fixes including ability now to place <scenario> tag immediately following <!DOCTYPE> tag.

3.2.9 02-07-2011
- Start in client mode even when first message is <recv> if <nop> preceeds it and -mc was specified (this eliminates need for <init> section in most cases).
- Fix bug associated with <exec command> as first statement
- Improve redirected output on windows, including waiting and retrying opening of exec log file to serialize exec output.
- Ensure dialog parameter not used with -mc option.

3.2.8 01-13-2011
- Add -trace_exec, -exec_file, -exec_overwrite parameters (to log stdout/stderr output from <exec>).
- Add -debug_file, -debug_overwrite parameters
- Add [contact_uri], [contact_value], [to_uri], [to_value], [from_uri], [from_value] keywords
- Add <exec verify="..."> option that waits for command to exit and validates return code was 0, aborting if not.
- Allow use of [remote_ip] and [local_ip] keywords in <init> section
- Modify tapress.pl to have delay between all key presses (rather than just digits)

3.2.7 12-20-2010
- Add [local_tag] [local_tag_param]
- Ad dump_xml  and -dump_sequence_diagram options
- Add parameterized includes

3.2.6 12-08-2010
- Add -trace_debug option to output information about SIPp execution
- Fix seg fault when using dump command without a parameter

3.2.5ed 11-17-2010
- Version format changed to parallel SF SIPp trunk which bumped version from 3.1 to 3.2
- Make <include> work relative to -sf directory and support embeded directories
- Extend test harness for cygwin to support windows test execution

3.14ed 11-10-2010
- Implement make install and make test targets
- Implement aa_expires option
- Implement ruby-based test harness in src/test directory
- Merge in two changes from sourceforge svn tree
  * Revision: 594 ENH: Added option to configure global T2 Timer (Patch contributed by sipp@hirschbichler.biz)
  * Revision: 595 FIX: sipp crashes when the line is too large. BugID-2968740(Patch contributed by Mitko-Mitev)

Initial cvs checkin is based on trunk version from sourceforge as of November 11, 2010, SIPp version 3.1.
All changes to date for enabling functional testing and improved ease of use:

* -mc option to enable dialog="n" option to messages
* allow dialog specification in keywords where this makes sense
* move per-dialog keywords (ie cseq) to per-dialog structure
* add additional keywords
* <xi:include> tag support
* auto-answer REGISTER requests when -aa is specified
* remove case sensitivity when parsing for To & From tags.
* print error message if address to bind to is in use (instead of silent quit)
* fix crash related to global statistics update
* Fix support for <exec> on Windows
* change char * to const char * where possible to reduce compiler warnings
* add additional debug target to makefile
* Fix worst formatting mistakes in terms of tab & indendation mis-usage
